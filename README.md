# C++ Basic Programs – Class and Object Concepts

## Aim
To implement and understand the basic concepts of C++ such as classes, objects, access specifiers, member functions, arrays, and simple arithmetic operations through a set of beginner-friendly programs.

## Theory
C++ is a powerful, object-oriented programming language that provides features for building efficient and organized software. One of the key strengths of C++ is its support for **classes and objects**, which help model real-world entities and enable modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

This project focuses on the following core C++ concepts:

### 1. Classes and Objects
- A **class** is a user-defined data type that contains variables (data members) and functions (member functions).
- An **object** is an instance of a class, used to access and manipulate the data inside it.
- This promotes **modularity**, **data abstraction**, and **reusability**.

### 2. Access Specifiers
- C++ uses **public**, **private**, and **protected** keywords to control access to class members.
  - **Public** members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
  - **Private** members can only be accessed within the class.
- This ensures **encapsulation**, protecting the internal state of an object from unintended interference.

### 3. Member Functions (Inside and Outside Class)
- Member functions can be written inside the class (inline) or defined outside using the **scope resolution operator (`::`)**.
- Writing functions outside the class helps separate interface from implementation, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

### 4. Arrays and Looping
- Arrays store multiple values of the same type.
- Looping (using `for`, `while`) is used to iterate through arrays, reverse elements, or perform operations on collections of data.
- Functions are used alongside arrays to improve code structure and reusability.

### 5. Arithmetic and Geometric Calculations
- Programs like Cube Volume, Cuboid Volume, and Rectangle Area demonstrate how simple mathematical formulas are implemented using class attributes and functions.
- These are useful in developing logic for real-world problem-solving using code.

### 6. Real-Life Abstraction
- Classes like `Car` and `Student` show how real-world objects can be represented in code using attributes and behaviors.
- This is the foundation of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and prepares learners for building complex systems later.

These programs help learners get hands-on experience with the **syntax, structure, and logic of C++**, building a solid foundation for more advanced topics.

## Algorithms

1. **Car Details.cpp**
   - Create a class with car attributes like brand, model, and year.
   - Input and display details using class functions.

2. **Cube Volume (Inside Class).cpp**
   - Define a cube class with side length.
   - Calculate volume inside the class using: `volume = side³`.

3. **Cube Volume (Outside Class).cpp**
   - Same as above, but define volume calculation outside the class.

4. **Cuboid Volume Inside Class.cpp**
   - Class with length, width, height.
   - Calculate volume inside the class: `volume = l × w × h`.

5. **Outside Class.cpp**
   - Demonstrates how to define class methods outside the class using `::`.

6. **Rectangle Area.cpp**
   - Class with length and breadth.
   - Calculate area: `area = length × breadth`.

7. **Reverse Array Outside Class.cpp**
   - Take input of array elements.
   - Reverse and print the array using a separate function.

8. **Simple Calculator.cpp**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) using conditional logic.

9. **Student Details.cpp**
   - Class with student name, roll, and marks.
   - Input and display using class methods.

## Conclusion
These programs provide a practical understanding of C++ fundamentals such as class creation, encapsulation, function definitions, and array manipulation. They serve as a stepping stone for beginners to build confidence and prepare for more advanced topics in C++, including inheritance, polymorphism, file handling, and data structures. This project helps develop structured thinking and object-oriented problem-solving skills.
