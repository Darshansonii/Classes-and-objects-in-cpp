# C++ Basic Programs – Class and Object Concepts

## Aim
To implement and understand the basic concepts of C++ such as classes, objects, access specifiers, member functions, arrays, and simple arithmetic operations through a set of beginner-friendly programs.

## Theory
C++ is an object-oriented programming language that uses the concept of classes and objects to structure code in a modular way. The key concepts demonstrated in this project include:

- **Classes and Objects**: A class defines a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that class.
- **Access Specifiers**: `private` and `public` are used to restrict or allow access to class members.
- **Member Functions**: Functions can be defined inside or outside the class using the scope resolution operator `::`.
- **Arrays**: Used to store multiple values, such as reversing an array.
- **Basic I/O**: Using `cin` and `cout` for input and output operations.
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods within a class for better structure and security.

## Algorithms

1. **Car Details.cpp**
   - Create a class with car attributes like brand, model, and year.
   - Input and display details using class functions.

2. **Cube Volume (Inside Class).cpp**
   - Define a cube class with side length.
   - Calculate volume inside the class using: `volume = side³`.

3. **Cube Volume (Outside Class).cpp**
   - Same as above, but define volume calculation outside the class.

4. **Cuboid Volume Inside Class.cpp**
   - Class with length, width, height.
   - Calculate volume inside the class: `volume = l × w × h`.

5. **Outside Class.cpp**
   - Demonstrates how to define class methods outside the class using `::`.

6. **Rectangle Area.cpp**
   - Class with length and breadth.
   - Calculate area: `area = length × breadth`.

7. **Reverse Array Outside Class.cpp**
   - Take input of array elements.
   - Reverse and print the array using a separate function.

8. **Simple Calculator.cpp**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) using conditional logic.

9. **Student Details.cpp**
   - Class with student name, roll, and marks.
   - Input and display using class methods.

## Conclusion
These programs provide a practical understanding of C++ fundamentals like class creation, encapsulation, function definition, and data handling. They serve as a solid starting point for beginners before moving on to advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.
